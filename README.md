# Youtube Live Helper
 
By installing this plugin you'll start seeing some statistics to the right of streams that I have in my database. There also will be some red dots on the progressbar. These indicate the best moments in the stream. My backend uses an extremly advanced AI (40 lines of code that search for moments with high chat interaction) to find the funniest/coolest moments.
